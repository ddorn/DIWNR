**For all the following exercices, you‚Äôre invited to always put yourself in the shoes of the Questioner. You‚Äôll need to give an answer to something the interlocutor (IL) has said, while applying the tip (‚öôÔ∏è) you're given. Pretend to be in a *live conversation*. You can also combine the tips as you learn them along the way.**

# 1 - üéØ Optimizing Rapport Management
Rapport is fundamental for having those discussions -it influences trust, the interpretation of what you're saying, and the ability to coherentize one's belief system. More importantly, if you're facing someone who is angry, spending time on the following techniques will allow you to calm the discussion down.

‚öôÔ∏è A good way to improve rapport is simply **rephrasing what your interlocutor has just said**. Make sure to include the **emotions** they mention, and to ask  **whether you got it right**. (e.g ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hesitate to tell me if I‚Äôm wrong). Try to stick to what they said, do not presume too much.

*This allows to make sure that you've understood them. It also forces you to pay more attention to what they're saying. Finally, it also avoids to incorrectly "ground": to signal that your interlocutor can proceed to the next point, despite the fact that you didn't understand.*

# 3 - üéØ Socratic Tests

Tests point to the logical relations between the different sentences that your interlocutor said. Due to the fact that interlocutors are more convinced by the inferences they draw themselves rather than the information they're being given directly, your goal is to help them make the right inferences -i.e logical or bayesian ones- by relying on elements they themselves introduced. Tests are ‚Äútransformations‚Äù of what your interlocutor said.

This is **not** something questioners usually improvise on the fly. Most of the time, they draw from a "library" of tests depending on what seems most fitting. I'll try to teach you a few tests.

 ‚öôÔ∏è First is the **Outsider Test**. This technique is good for beliefs that are usually attached to a "Me" or "Us". It consists in finding an similar case where someone would come to a different conclusion by relying on the same rationale.

Since tests can come off as a little upfront, you might want to add question verbs such as ‚ÄúI wonder whether‚Äù or ‚ÄúCould we say that‚Ä¶‚Äù to soothe it out.

# 5 - üéØ Managing Topics
Topics are the structure of your interlocutor's belief woven into conversation. Any of these topics usually have several versions of them, so you might ask for the "strongest", "most important", "main", or "most vivid" ones at each conversational step.

Here is a way (among other) to describe the typical structure you‚Äôll encounter :
(image)
C refers to the Claim : ‚ÄúI believe in God‚Äù. This is when you usually try to clear up definitions.

D is the Data : ‚ÄúI had a spiritual experience, once‚Äù. You often need to ask for an example at this point.

W is the Warrant, the link that justified inferring the Claim from the Data :
E.g. : ‚ÄúSpiritual experiences reveal deeper truth than science or logic‚Äù.

R is the Rebuttal : ‚ÄúUnless if the spiritual experience was induced by a drug or something but I don‚Äôt think it was the case‚Äù.

B is the Backing
Backing can exist for both Data (‚ÄúI was 13. I was praying with my aunt in a church‚Ä¶‚Äù) and the Warrant (‚ÄúI actually read a book titled ‚ÄúThe book of the Shaman‚Ä¶‚Äù)

Most importantly, we want two things :
1-Get to the right Data. Data sometimes has another Data behind it, and so on and so forth. You want to get to a concrete Data.
2-Once you have the right data, *Get to the Warrant and stick to it !* This is where the interlocutor‚Äôs epistemology happens, so be wary of falling inside unrelated Claims, optional Data, or unnecessarily detailed Backings.

# 6 - üîÑ  Data Transformation

Welcome to the harder part of the workshop !

Data Transformation is the key pattern behind eliciting pauses for reflection in your interlocutor‚Äôs attitude. It is the spice that transforms your dialog into a rational one. So what is it?

Data refers to the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù, the main reason behind an IL‚Äôs beliefs. (‚ÄúWhy do you believe in God ?‚Äù). Transformation refers to the act of taking this Data and ever-so-slightly modifying it (it has to stay compatible with the Warrant!). Let‚Äôs take an example :

Claim : ‚ÄúI believe in Karma.‚Äù
Data : ‚ÄúWhen I do something bad, like littering, I get karmically punished during the day -I‚Äôll break a nail, for example‚Äù. (Implicit Warrant : I can trust my personal experiences)
Transformed Data : ‚ÄúSuppose you do only good things throughout the day, you don‚Äôt litter, but you break a nail during that day. How do you call that ?‚Äù

Once the Data is transformed, the IL usually gives it a name. We call this ‚Äúeliciting an alternative‚Äù. You want the transformed data to be an alternative to the IL‚Äôs claim, but you don‚Äôt suggest it directly -instead, you try to get the IL to name it for you -you elicit it.

In our case, the IL decides to name ‚ÄúThings Happen‚Äù the case where they break a nail despite behaving properly.
The questioner then asks : ‚ÄúHow do you make a difference between Karmic Punishment and Things Happen ?‚Äù

The questioner contrasts the Alternative and the Claim. Implicitly, some psychologists believe that what is happening after this question is that the IL is prompted to do a Bayesian Contrasting : they contrast how plausible it is to see what they observe (breaking a nail) under both ‚Äúworlds‚Äù (Karma vs Things Happen). In this case, the IL realizes that the plausibility is the same, prompting them to realize that ‚Äúbreaking a nail‚Äù is actually not evidence for the existence of Karmic Punishment.

These moves are key to a successful conversation when it bears on matter-of-fact beliefs. Since they are so crucial, the next section is about practicing these very moves.
