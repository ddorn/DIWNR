# Yaml is a powerful language, and you can find a lot of documentation online.
# The few important things to know are:
# - Different documents (=exercises) are separated by ---
# - Yaml is indentation-sensitive, so be careful with the spaces. Everything at the same level of indentation is considered to be part of the same object.
# - The best way to write multiline strings is to use the | character, followed by a newline, and then the string, indented to match the | character.

name: 1 - Rephrasing
instructions: |
  **For all the following exercices, you‚Äôre invited to always put yourself in the shoes of the Questioner. You‚Äôll need to give an answer to something the interlocutor (IL) has said, while applying the tip (‚öôÔ∏è) you're given. Pretend to be in a *live conversation*. You can also combine the tips as you learn them along the way.**

  # 1 - üéØ Optimizing Rapport Management
  Rapport is fundamental for having those discussions -it influences trust, the interpretation of what you're saying, and the ability to coherentize one's belief system. More importantly, if you're facing someone who is angry, spending time on the following techniques will allow you to calm the discussion down.

  ‚öôÔ∏è A good way to improve rapport is simply **rephrasing what your interlocutor has just said**. Make sure to include the **emotions** they mention, and to ask  **whether you got it right**. (e.g ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hesitate to tell me if I‚Äôm wrong). Try to stick to what they said, do not presume too much.

  *This allows to make sure that you've understood them. It also forces you to pay more attention to what they're saying. Finally, it also avoids to incorrectly "ground": to signal that your interlocutor can proceed to the next point, despite the fact that you didn't understand.*

variations:
  - |
    IL: "I don't see why animal suffering matters, animals aren't intelligent."
    Inspiring yourself from the tip (‚öôÔ∏è) above, rephrase what they're saying.
  - |
    IL: "I think we shouldn't be afraid of AI."
    Inspiring yourself from the tip (‚öôÔ∏è) above, rephrase what they're saying.

name: 2 - Terminal Affiliation
instructions: |
  Sometimes, the rapport might imply someone who identifies you as being part of the ‚Äúother side‚Äù.

  ‚öôÔ∏è A way to counter this is to **find values that you share** with your interlocutor. l call this **"terminal affiliation"**.

  *Typically, values and terminal goals can be agreed upon. E.g.*

  *A: "I don't want to regulate AI because I want to protect the market and human innovation"*

  *B: "I agree that we should protect human flourishing and innovation".*

  Usually, facts or parts of one‚Äôs beliefs are harder to agree on, and even so might sound misleading (e.g. ‚ÄúI agree that it is unclear who killed Kennedy‚Äù might imply in your interlocutor‚Äôs mind that you should therefore agree with them that person X killed Kennedy).

  This allows to break the erroneous outgroup depiction one person might have. If you feel there is a risk of misrepresentation, you can also mention things that you don't agree with, although in contexts where you use this technique, a lot of disagreement is already anticipated.

variations:
  - |
    IL: "I hate progressives because they are threatening the safety of our institutions."
    Offer terminal affiliation.
  - |
    IL: "Climate Change is fake, it's a lie that's been put out there by the global elite".
    Offer terminal affiliation.
  - |
    IL: "I can't stand this whole lab meat research. My health is more important than their profit!"
    Offer terminal affiliation.

name: 3 - Encouraging
instructions: |
  ‚öôÔ∏èJust a side remark, you might want to **sparkle a few "Good", "Cool", "Ok", "I see", "Mhm"**, as your interlocutor is talking, and also at the start of your turn. This is called an **encourager**.

  *It signals that you've paid attention to what they've been saying, and that you ‚Äúclose‚Äù your speaking turn before starting a new one. This is crucial for maintaining good rapport.
  Note however that encouragers are not affiliation markers, they don't necessarily signal that you agree ! Rather, they signal that you "converge", that you jointly pay attention to what they pay attention to. In some languages, the encourager for "yes, I follow you" and the affiliation marker for "yes, I agree" are two different words.*

variations:

name: 4 - Enumerating
instructions: |
  ‚öôÔ∏è**Enumerating** helps to "converge" on the cognitive level, to validate the fact that you got their point across. It's usually done by means of "Not only do you... but you also..." or "Not only because... but also because..", etc.

variations:
  - |
    IL: "I can't stand those so-called effective charities, they don't care about economic development, they don't care about the local culture of the population they intervene on, and, like, where's my responsibility in giving them money?"

instructions: |
  ‚öôÔ∏è **Including the nuances** your interlocutor mention are also very welcome. E.g: ‚ÄúOn one side, you think that X, but on the other side, you also think that Y.‚Äù

variations:

name: 7 - Outsider Test
instructions: |
  Congrats! You finished section 2.
  # 3 - üéØ Socratic Tests

  Tests point to the logical relations between the different sentences that your interlocutor said. Due to the fact that interlocutors are more convinced by the inferences they draw themselves rather than the information they're being given directly, your goal is to help them make the right inferences -i.e logical or bayesian ones- by relying on elements they themselves introduced. Tests are ‚Äútransformations‚Äù of what your interlocutor said.

  This is **not** something questioners usually improvise on the fly. Most of the time, they draw from a "library" of tests depending on what seems most fitting. I'll try to teach you a few tests.

  ‚öôÔ∏è First is the **Outsider Test**. This technique is good for beliefs that are usually attached to a "Me" or "Us". It consists in finding an similar case where someone would come to a different conclusion by relying on the same rationale.

  Since tests can come off as a little upfront, you might want to add question verbs such as ‚ÄúI wonder whether‚Äù or ‚ÄúCould we say that‚Ä¶‚Äù to soothe it out.

variations:
  - |
    IL: "I believe in the christian God because my parents are christian."

name: 8 - Moorean Shift
instructions: |
  ‚öôÔ∏è Another test is the Moorean Shift. It simply consists of exploiting the logical equivalence A ‚Üí B ‚áí ¬¨B ‚Üí ¬¨A. This also induces a topic-shift.

  E.g (courtesy of EY) :

  *"Only God can build an A.I (this implies : If you are not God, you cannot build an AI)

  -If I build an AI, does that mean I'm God ?"*

  Notice the conversations switches from being about AI onto being about God, so make sure the result does orient you towards the topic you aim for.
  Sometimes, sticking to the exact same topic is a bit tricky. An alternative is to select a broader category:
  *-If I build something more advanced than a human, does that mean I'm superhuman?*

variations:

    IL: "Only aliens could build the pyramids, because they are so huge."

name: 9 - Modal breaching
instructions: |
  ‚öôÔ∏è Modal Breaching! Someone might use a weak modal, either explicitly ("I can", "one may") or implicitly ("I guess", "I think you would"). They point to a possible world that they still haven't explored yet. This consists in exploring the case where the modal is not verified.

  *E.g. :
  "I'm definitely my mother's son, because, I imagine that if I make a DNA test then it'll just match my parents‚Äô".
  "Let's suppose you make the DNA test and it doesn't match. Does that influence your belief ?"*

name: 10 - Transfers
instructions: |
  ‚öôÔ∏è**Transfers** are relatively simple. Psychologists usually categorize reasoning into different uses, called prospective and retrospective.
  - Prospective reasoning
      - inquiry
      - argumentation
      - prediction
  - Retrospective reasoning
      - explanation
      - justification

  Descriptively speaking, these uses are debatable. However, they offer you a good test. You can indeed test if assertions in one use transfer to the other use, e.g: IL:‚ÄùImmigrants want to replace us‚Äù Q:‚ÄùSo, if I give you the name of someone who does not want to replace us, then you‚Äôll be able to systematically guess that it‚Äôs not an immigrant ?‚Äù

  You don't need to limit yourself to these uses, of course. Most of the time, you depart from argumentation, and want to see if the reason used in another context still holds water (e.g, from argumentation to prediction, or from argumentation to explanation)

variations:

name: 12 - Managing topics
instructions: |
  # 4 - üéØ Managing Topics
  Topics are the structure of your interlocutor's belief woven into conversation. Any of these topics usually have several versions of them, so you might ask for the "strongest", "most important", "main", or "most vivid" ones at each conversational step.

  Here is a way (among others) to describe the typical structure you‚Äôll encounter :

  - C refers to the Claim: ‚ÄúI believe in God‚Äù. This is when you usually try to clear up definitions.
  - D is the Data: ‚ÄúI had a spiritual experience, once‚Äù. You often need to ask for an example at this point.
  - W is the Warrant, the link that justified inferring the Claim from the Data: E.g. ‚ÄúSpiritual experiences reveal deeper truth than science or logic‚Äù.
  - R is the Rebuttal: ‚ÄúUnless if the spiritual experience was induced by a drug or something but I don‚Äôt think it was the case‚Äù.
  - B is the Backing
  Backing can exist for both Data (‚ÄúI was 13. I was praying with my aunt in a church‚Ä¶‚Äù) and the Warrant (‚ÄúI actually read a book titled ‚ÄúThe book of the Shaman‚Ä¶‚Äù)

  Most importantly, we want two things:
  1. Get to the right Data. Data sometimes has another Data behind it, and so on and so forth. You want to get to concrete Data.
  2. Once you have the right data, Get to the Warrant and stick to it! This is where the interlocutor‚Äôs epistemology happens, so be wary of falling inside unrelated Claims, optional Data, or unnecessarily detailed Backings.

variations:
  - |
    IL: "Cool, I'm open for a discussion."
    Ask for a claim.
  - |
    IL: "I believe in Karma."
    Ask for Data.
  - |
    IL: "I believe in Karma because I just experience it every day."
    Ask for an example.
  - |
    IL: "Like, yesterday, I mentally insulted someone, and a few minutes later, my foot hit a table corner."
    Ask for a Warrant‚Ä¶ in an appropriate way.

    IL: "I believe this incident was Karma."
    Ask for a rebuttal.

  Participants are asked to complete the following exercise:

  ---
  Topics are the structure of your interlocutor's belief woven into conversation. Any of these topics usually have several versions of them, so you might ask for the "strongest", "most important", "main", or "most vivid" ones at each conversational step.

  Here is a way (among others) to describe the typical structure you‚Äôll encounter :
  (image)

  - C refers to the Claim: ‚ÄúI believe in God‚Äù. This is when you usually try to clear up definitions.
  - D is the Data: ‚ÄúI had a spiritual experience, once‚Äù. You often need to ask for an example at this point.
  - W is the Warrant, the link that justified inferring the Claim from the Data: E.g. ‚ÄúSpiritual experiences reveal deeper truth than science or logic‚Äù.
  - R is the Rebuttal: ‚ÄúUnless if the spiritual experience was induced by a drug or something but I don‚Äôt think it was the case‚Äù.
  - B is the Backing
  Backing can exist for both Data (‚ÄúI was 13. I was praying with my aunt in a church‚Ä¶‚Äù) and the Warrant (‚ÄúI actually read a book titled ‚ÄúThe book of the Shaman‚Ä¶‚Äù)

  Most importantly, we want two things:
  1. Get to the right Data. Data sometimes has another Data behind it, and so on and so forth. You want to get to concrete Data.
  2. Once you have the right data, Get to the Warrant and stick to it! This is where the interlocutor‚Äôs epistemology happens, so be wary of falling inside unrelated Claims, optional Data, or unnecessarily detailed Backings.

  Your task as an assistant is to provide them with feedback to improve on their rephrasing. Be concise.

examples:
  - original: "Cool, I'm open for a discussion."
    student: "Nice! Is there any belief that you hold that you'd want to talk about?"
    feedback: "Excellent!"
  - original: "I believe in Karma."
    student: "Why do you believe in Karma?"
    feedback: "Good, but imprecise: try to ask for the main reason why they believe in Karma"
  - original: "I believe in Karma."
    student: "What do you mean by Karma?"
    feedback: "Clarifying definitions is an important step, but this isn't Data. Ask what is the main reason why they believe in Karma."

  # 5 - üîÑ Data Transformation

  Welcome to the harder part of the workshop!

  Data Transformation is the key pattern behind eliciting pauses for reflection in your interlocutor‚Äôs attitude. It is the spice that transforms your dialog into a rational one. So what is it?

  Data refers to the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù, the main reason behind an IL‚Äôs beliefs. (‚ÄúWhy do you believe in God?‚Äù). Transformation refers to the act of taking this Data and ever-so-slightly modifying it (it has to stay compatible with the Warrant!). Let‚Äôs take an example:

  Claim: ‚ÄúI believe in Karma.‚Äù
  Data: ‚ÄúWhen I do something bad, like littering, I get karmically punished during the day - I‚Äôll break a nail, for example‚Äù. (Implicit Warrant: I can trust my personal experiences)
  Transformed Data: ‚ÄúSuppose you do only good things throughout the day, you don‚Äôt litter, but you break a nail during that day. How do you call that?‚Äù

  Once the Data is transformed, the IL usually gives it a name. We call this ‚Äúeliciting an alternative‚Äù. You want the transformed data to be an alternative to the IL‚Äôs claim, but you don‚Äôt suggest it directly - instead, you try to get the IL to name it for you - you elicit it.

  These moves are key to a successful conversation when it bears on matter-of-fact beliefs. Since they are so crucial, the next section is about practicing these very moves.

variations:
  - |
    IL: "I believe in Jehovah, because what is in the Bible is true. Unlike science, it never changes - e.g., the Bible says Babylon shall not be rebuilt, and it sits in ruins until today."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "Universal Basic Income isn‚Äôt plausible enough to be worth trying. I don't trust idealists and goody-two-shoes. I trust realists, like Margaret Thatcher."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "Veganism would require a huge shift in specialization for the existing animal agriculture workforce, and the government can‚Äôt pay for it enough."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "Video Games increase human interactions. They‚Äôre a very good way to organically meet new people and invite them home."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "Aliens don‚Äôt exist. We have tried to reach out to them several times, and we never received an answer."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "AI is useful for improving the justice system. Did you hear about that guy in Brighton who wrote an appeal for an unfair fine using ChatGPT?"
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "I defend AI because I‚Äôm in favor of freedom. AI helps with accessing and synthesizing information to make democratic decisions."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "We can‚Äôt possibly live in a simulation: it would require such amounts of time, energy, and compute, no one would actually create such a project."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "Mandatory vaccines weren‚Äôt a big factor in ending the Covid-19 pandemic. Vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "Any risk of extinction is a century off. Extinction risks are not nearly as important an issue as any other for now."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "GMOs are dangerous, since contamination threatens biodiversity."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.
  - |
    IL: "UFOs are actually interdimensional beings. That‚Äôs why they seem to defy physics."
    Transform this data. I will roleplay the IL if needed.

  Data Transformation is the key pattern behind eliciting pauses for reflection in your interlocutor‚Äôs attitude. It is the spice that transforms your dialog into a rational one. So what is it?

  Data refers to the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù, the main reason behind an IL‚Äôs beliefs. (‚ÄúWhy do you believe in God?‚Äù). Transformation refers to the act of taking this Data and ever-so-slightly modifying it (it has to stay compatible with the Warrant!). Let‚Äôs take an example:

  Step 1: Identify the topics
  Claim: ‚ÄúI believe in Karma.‚Äù
  Data: ‚ÄúWhen I do something bad, like littering, I get karmically punished during the day - I‚Äôll break a nail, for example‚Äù. (Implicit Warrant: I can trust my personal experiences)

  Step 2: Transform the Data
  Transformed Data: ‚ÄúSuppose you do only good things throughout the day, you don‚Äôt litter, but you break a nail during that day. How do you call that?‚Äù

  Step 3: Contrasting with the alternative
  Once the Data is transformed, the IL usually gives it a name. We call this ‚Äúeliciting an alternative‚Äù. You want the transformed data to be an alternative to the IL‚Äôs claim, but you don‚Äôt suggest it directly - instead, you try to get the IL to name it for you - you elicit it.

      Transform this data. I will be roleplaying the IL.
    student: "Can you think of a morning where you didn‚Äôt eat berries, and yet you weighed between 50 and 53 kgs?"
    feedback: "Excellent!"
  - original: |
      IL: "I believe eating berries in the morning makes you healthy because, when I do, I'm always between 50 and 53 kg."
      Ask for a false positive.
    student: "Do you remember a time when you ate berries and were not in that weight range?"
    feedback: "Not really, the interlocutor already said she only remembers being in this weight range. Try probing for a time when they did NOT eat berries yet were in this weight range."
